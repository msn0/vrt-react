# üì∏ @vrt/react

## Motivation

Once we have unit tests of React components or any other type of tests it's also good to have screenshots of presentational components. Unit tests describe the logic of our component but they don't say anything about how it should look like. It's an anti-pattern to unit-test whether the component has received a proper className - the className can be valid but the color, font-size, margin or any other css property might be wrong causing our component to be badly coloured, displaced or just to look bad.

GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket do have image diff tools. Once someone created a pull request with code changes it's very helpful to see how the code changes affect the look of the component. Having component's screenshot included in the pull request gives the reviewer a chance to see what's really going on with the component's look.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i --global @vrt/react
```

## Usage

```sh
  $ vrt --help

	Usage
	  $ vrt [<file|glob> ...]

	Options
      --fail    don't update snapshots, fail if they don't match
      --watch   keep the server running, watching and recompiling your files
      --config  path to config file
      --dev     make webpack create dev bundles

    Examples
      $ vrt
      $ vrt src/button/
      $ vrt src/button/.vrt.js
      $ vrt --watch
      $ vrt --config config/vrt.config.js --watch src/**/.vrt.js
```

### Basic example

Let's assume most simple case - we have a very simple `badge.js` component which doesn't take any props and doesn't have dependencies (except React), e.g.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Badge () {
    return (
        <div>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        </div>
    );
}
```

To capture a screenshot of it we need to create `.vrt.js` with a content:

```js
module.exports = {
    main: 'badge.js'
}
```

This `.vrt.js` file informs `@vrt/react` that it should generate one screenshot for `badge.js` file. We save `.vrt.js` next to our component, e.g.

```
src/components/badge
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ badge.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .vrt.js
```

Once we have it it's time to generate our first screenshot. Just run `vrt`, e.g.

```sh
$ npx vrt
```

### Component with props

Component's without props might be a rare case. Most of the time components do receive props, e.g.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Badge ({ num = 0 }) {
    return (
        <div>
            { num > 0 ? num : 'no' } new messages
        </div>
    );
}
```

There are two possible cases in here - the one with `num` greater then zero (e.g. ‚Äû7 new messages‚Äù) and the other one with `num` not being greater than zero (‚Äûno new messages‚Äù). To take a screenshots of these two cases we need to extend `.vrt.js` configuration and add possible `props` in the following way:

```js
module.exports = {
    main: 'badge.js',
    presets: [
        {
            name: 'some messages',
            props: {
                messages: 7
            }
        },
        {
            name: 'no messages',
            props: {
                messages: 0
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Run `npx vrt`. Two screenshots of our `Badge` component has been saved under `badge/__screenshots__` directory:

```
src/components/badge/__screenshots__
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ no-messages-snap.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ some-messages-snap.png
```

### Component with CSS modules

Let's say we have `badge.css` stylesheet and we import it inside our component, e.g.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styles from './badge.css';

export default function Badge ({ num = 0 }) {
    return (
        <div className={ styles.badge }>
            { num > 0 ? num : 'no' } new messages
        </div>
    );
}
```

When `@vrt/react` takes a screenshot of your component it bundles it with webpack under the hood. To make it ‚Äûunderstand‚Äù what `import styles from './badge.css` means we need to provide an appropriate loader, in this case it's possibly `css-loader` and `styles-loader`. We need to create a separate, global config for `@vrt/react` and feed it with loaders

```js
// vrt.config.js
module.exports = {
    webpack: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    'style-loader',
                    {
                        loader: 'css-loader',
                        options: { modules: true }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

We save this file under our project's root directory and give it the name `vrt.config.js`. If you don't use webpack and don't have these loaders as dependencies you need to install them.

Next we are ready to run `npx vrt`.

### Components with named imports

If your component exposes named import, e.g.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export function MyNamedcomponent () {
    // ...
}
```

then `namedImport` option should be used, e.g.

```js
module.exports = {
    main: 'my-named-component',
    presets: [
        {
            name: 'simplest case',
            namedImport: 'MyNamedComponent',
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

### Custom webpack loaders

If your component requires any other loaders to make it working - just add them to `vrt.config.js`. Please note that you don't need to add `babel-loader` - it's already added to make `@vrt/react` understand ES6 syntax.
